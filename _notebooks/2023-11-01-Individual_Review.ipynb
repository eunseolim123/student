    "- Question 3 (Skill 1.C): Definition of citizen science and examples\n",
    "  - Citizen science is also known as \"crowdsourcing\" or \"crowd-sourced science,\" and it is the growing practice of public involvement in the gathering, analyzing, or sorting of scientific data for research purposes.\n",
    "- Question 6 (Skill 5.A): Role of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n",
    "  - The IETF develops open standards through transparent processes with one goal in mind: to make the Internet work better.\n",
    "- Question 15 (Skill 5.A): Internet communication facts\n",

    "- Question 58 (Skill 1.C): How the Internet enables crowdsourcing\n",
    "  - The Internet can provide tools, information, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants and can lower geographic barriers to potential participants. However, there exist problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time, even with a distributed approach.\n",
    "- Question 59 (Skill 1.D): Lossy compression software definition\n",
    "  - In lossy compression, the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression (the data is permanently removed).\n",

    "- [Data Graphs + Sample](https://github.com/iKAN2025/frontend/issues/3).   This is a summary of how I made the first sample data graph that would reflect instrument practice for each user. The sample graph combines JavaScript and HTML. This integrates material from the second live review.\n",
    "- [Graphs Fix](https://github.com/iKAN2025/frontend/issues/7).   This is a quick discussion of the fixes to the graphs and the addition of 3 more graphs to account for each team member.\n",
    "- [Instrument Descriptions](https://github.com/iKAN2025/frontend/issues/6).  Addition of images, lengthened descriptions on instrument types and CSS formatting for each tab on navigation bar."

## Self Introduction
I was born in Seoul, South Korea and I moved to the US in 2009. 

- My family consists of me, my older brother, and two loving parents.
- I love art, and I've had over 10 art teachers in my life.
- I enjoy music. I play the piano and violin, and I lead an ensemble outside of school.

Go to [Time Box](http://localhost:4200/student/compsci) to see my Time Box.

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.

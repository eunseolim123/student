> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  
- Reviewed with Pair. Went over <b>[GitHub Pages](http://localhost:4200/student), [Time Boxes](http://localhost:4200/student/compsci)</b>.
- Planned for 1.1-1.4 Team Test

  - Created Agile Manifesto, Scrum Process on Canva
  - Split tasks and held daily meetings 
  - Kept communication through meetings, group chat, VSCode Live Share, Slack
- Program: Python Quiz
  - Program with output, input and output, list, iteration, selection and condition, program with a purpose
  - Added off of Mr. Mortenson's code, adding new questions, lists, made iterable, added exceptions, calculated percentage scores
  - Visual element added: print "Python Quiz"
  - Error: "Are your ready to take a test?" kept running even when typing "no", so exception was made for code to run only when user responds "yes"
  - Calculating percentage: (# of correct question / total # of questions) * 100
  - Tester function error, decided to put in next program instead

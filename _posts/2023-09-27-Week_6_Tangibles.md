### Week 6: Summary of Accomplishments
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  

- Met with Team LEIA, discussed plan for Passion Project
  - Several ideas were brought up: a fitness tracker, health & nutrition tracker, instrument practice tracker, study time tracker, check-up quiz
  - Ultimately decided on creating a check-up quiz that tracks time spent practicing instruments and sutudying
  - Split tasks and held daily meetings regarding progress and relationships of Passion Project to Web Programming Basics
  - Kept communication through meetings, group chat, Slack
- Group Review (Utterances):
  - Background image in HTML hacks wasn't generating properly, I altered the code to change the background image to the page itself instead of the tracker
  - Link names should be switched in <b>[DOM hacks](http://localhost:4200/student/basics/dom)</b>, not just the link itself (easy fix!)
  - Change "age in days" on <b>[JavaScript Data Types hacks](http://localhost:4200/student/basics/datatypes)</b> to something that doesn't involve inputting birthday (personal information) - changed to total time spent sleeping in a year
  - Make sure object manipulation works properly on <b>[JavaScript Data Types hacks](http://localhost:4200/student/basics/datatypes)</b>
  - Change background image on <b>[HTML hacks](http://localhost:4200/student/basics/html)</b> to fit screen and not get cut off (cover -> contain)
